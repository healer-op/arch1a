Refund Policy – ArchiaStudio
At ArchiaStudio, we put significant time, expertise, and financial investment into every project we take on. By engaging with our services, you agree to the following Refund Policy:

1. No Refunds After Project Start
Once a project begins, no refunds will be issued.
This is because we immediately allocate resources such as:

Server costs
Development time
Third-party tools and APIs
Design and planning work
Dedicated manpower
These operational investments cannot be recovered once the project has started.

2. Advance / Booking Amount
All advance payments or booking fees are non-refundable, as they secure project slots, resources, and initial setup costs.

3. Exceptional Cases (If Applicable)
Refunds may only be considered if:
Work has not yet started, and
No resources have been consumed
(ArchiaStudio reserves the right to assess and decide these cases fairly.)
📦TIMEFARE (Refund): 1-2    weeks depending upon the project.

4. Service Interruptions or Technical Delays
If there are delays caused by external factors (hosting providers, third-party APIs, etc.), we will work to resolve the issue as quickly as possible.
However, these situations do not qualify for refunds.

5. Client Responsibilities
Clients are responsible for providing:
Correct content
Timely feedback
Required credentials or materials
Delays caused by the client do not qualify for refunds.

6. Digital Goods (AI Tools / Software / ArchiaAI)
Any AI-generated content, software access, blog generation tools, or digital products (including ArchiaAI) are non-refundable due to server, computation, and operational costs that occur instantly upon usage.

7. Agreement
By purchasing or subscribing to any ArchiaStudio service, the client acknowledges and agrees to this Refund Policy.
